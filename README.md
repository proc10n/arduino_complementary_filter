# Arduino Complementary Filter


Simple Arduino implementation of a complementary filter. Uses the MPU6050.h library by Electronic Cats.

Nothing really amazing, but it works.

Offset values in the code are my own IMU offset values. If you want to find yours, 
the Electronic Cats MPU6050 has a sample code that finds it for you. I don't know how it works.
